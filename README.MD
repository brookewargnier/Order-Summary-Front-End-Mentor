### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

This was the first site I've built on my own without a tutorial, so there was A LOT that I learned throughout the process.

This includes my first time outside of a tutorial/learning setting using:

flexbox
grids
hover states
media queries
nested CSS classes


### Continued development

I want to focus next on gradual rescaling of content as the screen changes sizes, as oppose to the designs current state, which is an abrupt change in size.

I also want to improve on CSS organization and learn more about how to organize files in an efficient way. I'm sure I've made tons of mistakes here, because I was definitely learning as I was coding.

I also know for the next time to take some time before starting to really think and plan how content is going to be built and nested within each other. Basically put, to write a plan of action. This could have saved me from a lot of re-writes and starting over.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - This taught me a lot about how to create flexboxes and made me a lot more comfortable working with layouts.

### Time

- This challenge was started 8/25/2021 and completed 8/26/2021
